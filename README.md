# Dynamic-Price
Dynamic Pricing for Hotels!

Hotel Industry has started with the concept of dynamic pricing since early 2000, with the likes of Marriot, Hilton and InterContinental.

The objective oof this project is very the same and I build a model for incorporating the change in pricing automatically!

The points that are taken into consideration while building the model are:

- Statistical Market Research
- Occupancy Matrix
- Surge Price Index

I aim to keep on improving the model and design long forecast scenarios for months which are limited to three days from today!
